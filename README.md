#Hackathon18
Hi there, welcome to the code for the CUNY Hackathon project. My team had fallen apart and I was tasked with fixing up the website which I had to start from scratch using code I found online. We were unable to connect any APIs to the site, so it lacks function, but it was a great exercise in learning some HTML and web design.
